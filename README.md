# Musical-Solid-State-Tesla-Coil
Circuit design and implementation of a Musical Solid State Tesla Coil using Slayer Exciter.

<ins> SIMULATION </ins>:
Just launch the .asc file on LTSpice and put the prob on Vout.

You can download LTSpice Simulation Software this way for Windows and MacOs : https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice-simulator.html#

<ins> IMPLEMENTATION </ins>:

The circuit has been implmented using a 50cm long second coil. Some pictures are coming.

Enjoy :)
